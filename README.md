# 🍷 Wine Quality Predictor

A machine learning project that classifies wine quality (Bad, Average, Good) using physiochemical features like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol, etc. The model has been deployed using **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Predicts wine quality (Bad, Average, Good) using XGBoost classifier
- 📈 Trained and tested on both red and white wine datasets
- 🎛️ Feature scaling with PowerTransformer
- 📊 Streamlit web interface with sliders for input features
- 📉 Evaluation of multiple classifiers for benchmarking
- 🧠 Final model achieves **high precision on class 2 (Good Quality)**

## 📊 Classifier Comparison

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 65.04%   | 0.65      | 0.65   | 0.65     |
| KNN Classifier       | 70.56%   | 0.70      | 0.70   | 0.70     |
| SVM Classifier       | 72.44%   | 0.72      | 0.72   | 0.72     |
| Decision Tree        | 67.86%   | 0.68      | 0.68   | 0.68     |
| Random Forest        | 74.26%   | 0.74      | 0.74   | 0.74     |
| Gradient Boosting    | 73.80%   | 0.74      | 0.74   | 0.74     |
| **XGBoost (Final)**  | **74.04%** | **0.79 (class 2)** | **0.83 (class 2)** | **0.81 (class 2)** |

> 📌 *The XGBoost classifier was selected as the final model due to its strong performance on the "Good Quality" (class 2) category.*
